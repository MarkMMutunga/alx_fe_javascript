## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions
- `populateCategories()`: Dynamically extracts and populates category options
- `filterQuotes()`: Filters displayed quotes based on selected category
- `saveLastSelectedFilter()`: Persists filter selection to localStorage
- `loadLastSelectedFilter()`: Restores last filter selection on page load

### Server Sync Functions
- `initializeServerSync()`: Sets up automatic synchronization
- `performServerSync()`: Executes sync operations with conflict resolution
- `fetchServerData()`: Simulates fetching data from JSONPlaceholder API
- `syncWithServer()`: Merges local and server data with conflict detection
- `handleConflicts()`: Resolves data conflicts using server-priority strategy
- `manualSync()`: User-triggered synchronization function

### DOM Manipulation
- Dynamic category dropdown population
- Real-time quote filtering and display
- Interactive form creation and management
- Responsive error and success messaging
- Sync status indicators and conflict notifications

## Server Simulation

The application uses JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to simulate server interactions:
- **Fetches posts** and converts them to quotes for demonstration
- **Simulates conflicts** by comparing local vs server data
- **Handles POST requests** when adding new quotes
- **Implements retry logic** for failed network requests

## Files

- `index.html` - The main webpage with filtering and sync interface
- `script.js` - JavaScript code with DOM manipulation, storage, filtering, and sync functionality
- `README.md` - This documentation
- `sample-quotes.json` - Example JSON file for testing import functionality
- `server-data-example.json` - Example server data format for reference

## Getting Started

Just open the `index.html` file in any web browser to start using the quote generator with full filtering and server sync capabilities. The application will automatically begin syncing with the simulated server.
